# Sonar-Signal-Classification
The Sonar Data Classification project involves building a machine learning model to classify sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock. This project is based on the sonar dataset, which contains 60 features representing energy levels in different frequency bands.
